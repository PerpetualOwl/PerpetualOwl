Hi, I'm PerpetualOwl, better known as Howard Huang.

I am a junior (class of 2026) at Harvard College who does lots of small coding projects on the side.
I am planning to concentrate in Applied Mathematics.
You can contact me through discord at `PerpetualOwl`.
You may also find me on campus if you are a classmate, and I would love to say hi.
